        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>ALL LINES MUST HAVE OPENING AND CLOSING BRACKETS</li>
          <li>
            In "semantic" html elements, the name of the element describes its
            content/role on the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-semantic elements are solutions to structual problems such as
            div
          </li>
          <li>
            As just mentioned before, div, creates a division in a page while,
            span, creates an inline division.
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the vidisble content shown to the user
          </li>
          <li>
            h1 should appear once! h1-h6 and they progessivly become smaller
            headers
          </li>
          <li>
            ul, is unordered lists, ol are ordered lists, and li is bulleted or
            numbered list.
          </li>
          <li>
            src is an attribute and for pictures is shows the location of the
            image on your computer.
          </li>
          <li>br creates a line break of empty space.</li>
          <li>
            a is an attribute that stands for anchor which creates a link to
            some other webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The section contains the thematic content, and allows us to organize
            the content based on topics we have.
          </li>
          <li>
            id is a attribute and a way to identify elements as you select the
            name of a specific section.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inline CSS: style directly in html file, using a style attribute
            with CSS rule to style a particular page element ONLY. One bad thing
            however is, each inline stlye must be edited INDIVUALLY whenever
            change is needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intertnal style sheet: contains css rules in the head section of the
            html file.
          </li>
          <li>
            External CSS style sheet: MOST CONMMON, keep css rules in seperate
            file. example of linking it is in this file.
          </li>
          <li>
            A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or
            declartions will apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declations contain two parts, propety/value. The property that we
            would like to apply and the value to that propety.
          </li>
          <li>
            margin indciates how much space we would like around the OUTSIDE of
            the document, setting it to 0 leavrs no extra space.
          </li>
          <li>
            padding adds space around the content on the INSIDE of the element,
            when increasing padding you are making an entire element bigger.
          </li>
          <li>
            "*" is a special wild card symbol which allows us to apply rule to
            all visible elements on the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some selector examples are, h1, header, footer, img, ul, etc...
          </li>
          <li>
            You can combine two selectors which helps us write "Do not repeat
            yourself"/DRY code.
          </li>
          <li>
            To assign a class in css you use a period before naming the class
            you are assigning. For example, in this files css document, the
            period before card is designating this as a class slector.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <li>git status: checks what brancg we are currently on</li>
          <li>
            git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it
          </li>
          <li>Step 1: git add -A, stages the commits.</li>
          <li>Step 2: press commit in vs code.</li>
          <li>Step 3: git coomit -m "enter commit message".</li>
          <li>
            Step 4: git pull origin main, pulls base branch to the feature
            branch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 5: git push origin feature/morehtml, the second part is an
            example and it pushes changes to a remote repository.

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A programming language that allows users to interact with the
            website.
          </li>
          <li>.js file extension indicates a file is javascript.</li>
          <li>
            A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code, var. An example would be var shape = "circle". container is
            named shape, the equal sign is the assignment operator and it used
            to assign specific data we want stored in the variable, and finally
            circle is the data stored in shape.
          </li>
          <li>String is another word for valve.</li>
          <li>Each javascript line ends with a semi colon ";".</li>
          <li>
            console.log outputs a message to the web by adding an argument. An
            ex would be console.log(topics); which adds the value of topics to
            the web console since its in the parenthesis.
          </li>
          <li>
            The .log is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be
            executed by a computer, it will output whatever is in the
            parenthesis in the console on chrome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use chrome dev tools to view console.log output, and the command to
            open dev tools is CMD + OPT + i.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow can be interupted but thats why we use conditional
            statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed,
            or if its even executed at all.
          </li>
          <li>
            if statements code will only execute if the statement meets the
            condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use else if statements, block of code to be executed if first if
            isnt true.
          </li>
          <li>
            = = = is a strict equality operation, checks to see if 2 values are
            equal.
          </li>
          <li>if statements allow us to interupt control flow.</li>
          <li>An array stores a group of related data, single variable.</li>
          <li>Strings in arrays habve parenthesis.</li>
          <li>
            Array index, lets us add location to work with indivdual data in an
            array.
          </li>
          <li>
            for loops use predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on
            all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed
            over and over.
          </li>
          <li>
            You find length of array by using the built in property, length in
            the array.
          </li>
          <li>Use x so start at the begining. x = 0.</li>
          <li>x + + shortcut for x + 1.</li>
          <li>
            Commenting out the code, use /* before and */ after to making code
            inactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions are a set of intstructions that tells the computer how to
            perform a certain task, does not automatically execute.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must call the funtion. An example would be makeTea(); . This is
            calling the makeTea function.
          </li>
          <li>
            ALWAYS REMEMBER THE EMPTY PARENTHESIS AFTER FUNCTION NAME WHEN
            CALLING FUNCTION.
          </li>
          <li>
            ALWAYS REMEMBER THE OPENED AND CLOSED CURLY BRACKETS WHEN WRITING
            THE FUNCTION.
